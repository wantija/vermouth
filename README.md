## What it does

Vermouth keeps a list of your games and applications, paired with a Proton or Wine version. Double-click to launch. That's pretty much it.
It works like Lutris, Heroic, Fagus or Bottles, but:

- It's KDE first (written in Qt/Qml and using Kirigami)
- It tries to be lighter and easier to use - less buttons, checks and knobs, just the bare necessities.

Additionally:

- It searches for Proton versions from your Steam installation automatically, including custom ones like GE-Proton
- You can download the latest GE-Proton release with one click if you don't have Steam
- You can place custom Proton builds in its local folder (usually `~/.local/share/vermouth/protons`, there's a button to open it)
- Wine works too - just point it at the Wine binary and set a prefix folder
- It will try to extract icons from .exe files so the grid actually looks nice - install `icoutils` to enable this
- You can define launch options with `%command%` placeholder, same as in Steam (e.g. `mangohud %command%`, `GAMEID=12345 %command%`)
- You can run a separate .exe inside an existing prefix (useful for installers, config tools, etc.)
- You can run common Wine utilities in the prefixes - winecfg, regedit, winetricks
- You can create start menu entries and desktop shortcuts for individual games, and they work without opening the application window
- You can prevent the system from sleeping while a game is running
- HDR can be toggled per-session on KDE - enabling it also sets the required Proton environment variables automatically
- Big screen mode (beta), gamepad navigation
- You can launch native binaries, desktop entries and appimages

### umu-launcher support

Vermouth supports [umu-launcher](https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher), which runs Proton through the full Steam Runtime (pressure-vessel). This significantly improves game compatibility - especially for games with video cutscenes, media codecs, or anti-cheat. It is strongly recommended.

If `umu-run` is found in your `PATH` or configured in Settings, Vermouth will use it automatically for all Proton launches. You can also download it directly from Settings → umu-launcher.

## Building from source

You need Qt 6.8+, KDE Frameworks 6, and CMake.

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ extra-cmake-modules qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel \
  qt6-qtquickcontrols2-devel kf6-kirigami-devel kf6-kcoreaddons-devel kf6-ki18n-devel \
  kf6-qqc2-desktop-style icoutils
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake extra-cmake-modules qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev \
  qt6-tools-dev-tools libkirigami-dev libkf6coreaddons-dev libkf6i18n-dev \
  libkf6qqc2desktopstyle-dev icoutils
```

**Arch Linux:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake ninja extra-cmake-modules qt6-base qt6-declarative \
  kirigami ki18n kcoreaddons qqc2-desktop-style icoutils
```

Then inside the root folder of the project:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/bin/vermouth
```

## Bug reporting and feature requests

Please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dekomote/vermouth/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

## How to use it

Open the app, click **Add App/Game**, browse for the .exe file, choose a Proton version from the dropdown (click **Download GE Proton** if you don't have any), and launch from the grid.

Optional fields can be omitted - the name and icon will be inferred from the exe (requires `icoutils`), and the prefix will be set automatically based on the game name and your default prefix folder.

The **Launch Options** field lets you wrap the command with tools like `mangohud`, `gamescope`, or `gamemoderun`. Use `%command%` as the placeholder for where the actual game command goes - if you leave it out, your options are prepended automatically. You can also set environment variables here, e.g. `GAMEID=12345 %command%` to pass a Steam App ID to umu-launcher for game-specific Proton fixes.

In **Settings** you can:
- Configure [umu-launcher](#umu-launcher-support) for better game compatibility
- Set the default prefix folder
- Add extra folders to scan for Proton installations

## FLATPAK NOTES

When running Vermouth as a Flatpak, it is sandboxed and cannot access your filesystem by default. You need to grant it access to the folder(s) containing your games using [Flatseal](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.tchx84.Flatseal) or your desktop environment's application permissions settings. Add the relevant paths under **Filesystem** permissions.

To detect Proton versions from your Steam installation, add `~/.steam:ro` and `~/.local/share/Steam:ro`.

To create desktop shortcuts for your games, add `xdg-desktop` to filesystem permissions.

## How it works

Games are stored in `~/.config/vermouth/apps.json`. When umu-launcher is available, Proton is launched through it with `PROTONPATH` and `STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH` set. Without umu, Vermouth calls the `proton run` script directly, the same way Steam does. Wine games get `WINEPREFIX` set and the binary called directly.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/dekomote/vermouth).

### Code

Build from source (see [Building from source](#building-from-source)), make your changes, and open a pull request. Keep changes focused - one feature or fix per PR.

### Translations

Vermouth uses the KDE i18n system (gettext `.po` files). To add or update a translation:

1. Create a folder `po/<language_code>/` (e.g. `po/fr/` for French, `po/pt_BR/` for Brazilian Portuguese).
2. Copy `po/vermouth.pot` into it as `vermouth.po` (e.g. `po/fr/vermouth.po`).
3. Fill in the `msgstr` fields with your translations.
4. Open a pull request with your new folder.

To update an existing translation after new strings have been added:

```bash
sh po/Messages.sh       # regenerate vermouth.pot from source
sh po/update-po.sh      # merge new strings into all .po files
```

Then fill in any new empty `msgstr ""` entries in your `.po` file.
